# UK police data

CSV files are available here:

https://data.police.uk/data/

Once downloaded, rename as "uk_police.csv"

I have not systematically checked, but the data for each police force seems to
be in the same format.

The time stamp is only at _month_ resolution, and as downloaded, each month's
date resides in a separate file.  These will need to be manually joined before
being used.
